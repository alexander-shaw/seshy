# Seshy

## An events app that helps college students effortlessly create, discover, and attend real-world experiences.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter build or runtime errors, see [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for detailed solutions:

- **Build errors:** "Multiple commands produce" errors (often from duplicate DTO files after Git rebases)
- **Runtime errors:** Core Data persistent store errors ("no persistent stores" after schema changes)
